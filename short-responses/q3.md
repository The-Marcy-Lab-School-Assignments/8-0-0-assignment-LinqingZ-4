# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in a `controller` as the second argument.

What is a controller?

# Answer
A controller is a function that handles the logic for a specific route. A controller typically takes two parameters:
- req (the request object): Contains information about the HTTP request, such as query parameters, body data, headers, etc.
- res (the response object): Used to send a response back to the client.
